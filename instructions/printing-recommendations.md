# Printing Recommendations
> [!NOTE]
> Total time spent printing is 24 hours per winding unit
>
> Total filament used is approximately 300g per winder

* These are general priting recommendations. 
* Remember that you know your printer better than I.

## General Advice
1. The following models will require support:
    * `STRUCT_mid_plate`
    * `watch_mount`
1. The model is designed to be printed with PLA, therefore tolerances are spec'd for that
    * Tolerances are between `0.1 - 0.2mm`
1. Print with 25% infill
    * This will the increase overall rigidity of the model, especially when dealing with the motor's torque.
    * This will also give you a "premium feeling" product.
1. [If your printer has a tendency elephant foot](https://3dprinterly.com/how-to-fix-bottom-of-3d-print-that-looks-bad/), you'll need to file down some of the pieces.
    * For example, the `mounting_dowel`'s outter lip will need to be filed down so the `mounting_dowel_sleeve` can easily slip over it.
