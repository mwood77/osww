# Bill of Materials & Cost

## Tools and skills you already have

- 3D printer + filament (approx 300g per winder)
- Soldering iron & the skills to use it
- Basic tools
    - Screwdriver
    - Hack saw or a rotary tool with a cut-off wheel (to cut the 4mm metal rod to size)
    - Sandpaper or files. This will depend on how dialed-in your 3D printer is.
- Epoxy glue
    - Again, whether you need this or not will depend on how dialed-in your 3D printer is.
- How to use a multimeter (we'll only check for continuity)
- Some spare small-gauge wire (ex. 22 AWG)
- Rudimentary knowledge of electronics

## Required parts
The following parts list will allow you to build:
- 1x powered winder (required)
- 2x unpowered winders (optional)

This means that you'll be able to construct a 3-watch winder. Remember that the system is modular, so if you decide to only build a single powered winder, that's ok.


### Total cost of required Parts
- **$37.00 (February 2023)**

> While most of these components are standardized, I will not be able to assist you if you purchase your components from a separate supplier, as the winder was designed around the components (as supplied) beneath.
